Unity version: 6000.2.7f2
Rules:
ArchDawn will only make changes to 'Game' scene
Everyone, including myself, with have their own scene to do work in.
Everyone should work on thier own branch, and murge them into main once the work they prefromed is considered 'stable'
The game utilizes and 'initalizer' which will manage the loading intigration in a step-by-step manner.
Avoid using 'start' methods as the initalizer will call upon each script when creating a scene, and set-up should be called when spawning enemies
